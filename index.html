              Hi, my name is Jessie Sidhu and I'm excited to take this full-stack 
              bootcamp with everyone! I have no coding experience at the moment but 
              i've already learned a lot in the first week!! Picking the Berkeley 
              Bootcamp was probably the best decision I could make as I live in 
              Hercules, CA which is 15 minutes northbound from Berkeley. All the 
              other bootcamps I looked at were all in San Francisco and it just 
              didn't make sense to me to commute that far.
              <br><br>
              My background for work is in Finance and Business Management. After 
              college, I got a job near St. Louis, Missouri working in Finance and 
              Budgeting; I worked there for about 3 years. I learned a lot but I 
              really missed California! When I got back to California I semi-changed 
              my field of work and got a job in Management working for Tesla as a 
              Production Manager. I did seem to enjoy production a bit more than 
              finance but at the end of the day, I still didn't seem satisfied.
          
              In conclusion, I'm really happy I decided to join a bootcamp and do more for myself!
